The project, developed using React, includes several key components and modules that provide the functionality of a web application. The header features a logo, navigation bar, search bar, and buttons for navigating to favorite items and the shopping cart. It uses the Context API to fetch data about favorite and cart items, and it also supports saving the state of favorite items in the browser's local storage.

The loader component is a simple animation displayed during data loading. The navigation bar facilitates navigation between different product categories, such as phones, tablets, and accessories, and it responds to URL changes by highlighting the active menu item. Pagination allows managing product list pages, supporting transitions between pages, and displaying a specific number of products per page.

The photo slider displays an automatically scrolling image slider, responds to swipe gestures, and includes navigation buttons for switching between images. The product card displays information about a product, including an image, name, price, and technical specifications, and contains buttons for adding the product to the cart and favorites. The product card skeleton is used as a placeholder during data loading. The product list shows a list of products with sorting and filtering options, and supports pagination for navigating between product pages.

The product search functionality allows searching for products by name. The product slider displays a horizontally scrollable product slider with navigation buttons for switching between products. An additional button allows adding a product to favorites and responds to changes in the state of favorite items by changing the icon accordingly.

Overall, the project ensures convenient navigation and interaction with products, using modern approaches to web application development based on React, optimized for high performance and user convenience. Key technologies used in the project include React for building user interfaces, the Context API for state management, and local storage for persisting data.
